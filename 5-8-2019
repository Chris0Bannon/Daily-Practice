    </header>
   <p> I am excited to begina regular and personal practice to build my skills.  I hope that this becomes a log that I am able to add daily entries into.  Today I am working through the Technical foundations section of the Prime Learning Email.  There is not much for me to actually show here, as the majority of these resources are videos.  I have watched <a href= "https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/internet-intro" this video series</a> that explains how the interenet was created and how it functions. I also began the command line tutorial from codeacademy.  <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-the-command-line" Here <a> I only completed the first lesson here today.  But will finish the second soon. </p>
